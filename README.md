**To-Do List Application**
A simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users manage their daily tasks by allowing them to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Additionally, it includes a "Clear All Tasks" feature and supports task persistence using localStorage.
**Features**
1. Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks using an input field and a button.
2. Mark Tasks as Complete: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status (e.g., line-through for completed tasks).
3. Delete Individual Tasks: Users can remove tasks one by one using a "Delete" button.
4. Clear All Tasks: A button to clear the entire list of tasks.
5. Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage so they remain even after refreshing the page.
6. Responsive Design: The app is styled to look good on all devices.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: For creating the structure of the application.
CSS: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and functionality.

**How to Use**
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as complete (strikethrough effect).
4. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.
5. Use the "Clear All Tasks" button to delete all tasks at once.
6. Tasks will automatically be saved to localStorage and reloaded when you revisit the app.
